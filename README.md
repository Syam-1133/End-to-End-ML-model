# End-to-End-ML-model
This project demonstrates the implementation of an end-to-end machine learning model using the [Algerian Forest Fires dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires). The goal of this model is to predict forest fire occurrences based on various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
